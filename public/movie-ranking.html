<p>It is a 3 hours + movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro and directed by Martin Scorsese. It is based on a true story with stellar cast, cinematic excellence, compelling storytelling and a wonderful musical score. 
    Despite the long duration, I promise it is worth watching.</p>

<a href="https://tinyzonetv.se/watch-movie/watch-saltburn-2023-free-103360.10131601"><img src="https://img.tinyzonetv.se/xxrz/250x400/202/71/88/7188b0108a04fbf77d37d96da0e25026/7188b0108a04fbf77d37d96da0e25026.jpg" height="200"></a>
<p>Saltburn is a spectacularly crafted masterpiece, a paced, and performed satire of wealth and extravegance...that simultaneously works to slowly peelback of the layers of each character scene by scene,
    until the audience is fully aware of what is happenning - but cannot begin to look away as the proverbial train car goes flying off the tracks.</p>

<a href="https://tinyzonetv.se/watch-movie/watch-foe-2023-free-102445.10072879"><img src="https://img.tinyzonetv.se/xxrz/250x400/202/1f/e2/1fe2a5d40f405d41a09a832857ce07b0/1fe2a5d40f405d41a09a832857ce07b0.jpg" height="200"/></a>
<p>I was drawn in straightaway as the suspense was 10/10. Then I was blown away when it all fell together. A quiet movie for a quiet night in. 
    The movie is a thought provoking and eerily dystopian look at the possible uses for synthetic AI.</p>
